# notes about dictionaries 
"""
it's a way to store data like a list
but instead of only using numbers to get the data, you can use anything
the Dictionary data structure in python lets you treat a dict like it's a database for:
	organizing and storing data
	
example of a list in python: 

things = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
print(things[1])
b

things[1] = 'z'
print(things[1])
z

things
['a', 'z', 'c', 'd']

you can only use numbers to get things in lists

example of using a dictionary instead:

stuff = {'name': 'Zed', 'age': 39, 'height': 6 * 12 +2}
print(stuff['name'])
Zed

print(stuff['age'])
39

print(stuff['height'])
74

stuff['city'] = "SF"
print(stuff['city'])
SF

^^^ you can see that instead of using numbers to call the location of something like we have to in lists,
in dictionaries we can call using strings. it doesn't have to be strings though. We can also do this:

stuff[1] = "Wow"
stuff[2] = "Neato"
print(stuff[1])
Wow
print(stuff[2])
Neato

ok and then here's how to delete things:

del stuff['city']
del stuff[1]
del stuff[2]
stuff
{'name': 'Zed', 'age': 39, 'height': 74}
