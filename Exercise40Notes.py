# notes on Modules, Classes, and Objects
"""
Python is an object oriented programming language 
Object Oriented Programming = OOP
learning here about classes and objects through what we know about dictionaries and modules

dictionary = a way to map one thing to another 
example:

"""

mystuff = {'apple': "I AM APPLES!"}
print(mystuff['apple'])

# You can think about a module as a specialized dictionary that can store Python code so you can access
	# it with the . operator.
